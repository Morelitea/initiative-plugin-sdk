# initiative-plugin-sdk

Build a plug-in for [Initiative](https://github.com/beyonders-studio/initiative): a
service that reads and writes a community's content, answers Initiative's
calls, and draws tiles on its dashboards.

A plug-in is its logic. You write one typed definition of its endpoints, hooks,
schedules, widgets and listing; the SDK serves it, verifies Initiative's calls,
holds its tokens, and builds its manifest.

| Import | Holds |
|---|---|
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest` | `definePlugin`, `defineEndpoint`, the contract's types, `validateManifest`, `pluginApiCompatible` |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/server` | `createPlugin`, `serve`, `EndpointError` |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/client` | `Initiative` and the `Client` it gives, acting as the community or a member; plug-in keys |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/widget` | What a widget is handed, and the scenes it returns |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/testing` | A declarative plug-in's requests and maps, run against recorded vendor answers |
| `initiative-plugin-sdk/plugin-api.json` | The plug-in API contract: the OpenAPI document of every route a plug-in may call |
| bin `initiative-plugin` | `init`, `build`, `pack`, `dev`, `validate`, `keygen`, `uid`, `schema` |

Node 20 or later. Two runtime dependencies, `ajv` and `jsonata`; everything
cryptographic uses `node:crypto`. `initiative-plugin build` bundles widgets with
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), which you install beside the SDK:

```sh
npm install initiative-plugin-sdk
npm install --save-dev esbuild
```

## 1. Define the plug-in

```ts
// src/plugin.ts
import { definePlugin, defineEndpoint } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest";

export const openTickets = defineEndpoint({
  direction: "read",
  label: { en: "Open tickets" },
  params: { project: { type: "string", label: { en: "Project" } } },
  returns: {
    titles: { type: "string", list: true },
    total: "int",
  },
  handler: async ({ params, installation, client }) => {
    const tickets = await lookUp(installation, params.project);
    return { result: { titles: tickets.map((ticket) => ticket.title), total: tickets.length } };
  },
});

export default definePlugin({
  publicId: "acme.tracker",
  uid: "K7M2QX8N4TVB9C", // npx initiative-plugin uid, once
  name: "Acme Tracker",
  scopes: ["projects:read", "comments:write"],
  endpoints: { "open-tickets": openTickets },
  schedules: {
    sweep: { every: "15m", run: async ({ since, installation, client }) => { /* … */ } },
  },
  widgets: {
    "open-count": {
      meta: { name: { en: "Open tickets" } },
      endpoints: ["open-tickets"],
      module: "src/widgets/open-count.ts",
      sample_data: { "open-tickets": { total: 12 } },
    },
  },
});
```

- **Types come from the definition.** An endpoint's `params` type what its
  handler is handed, and its `returns` type what the handler answers with: a
  return of the wrong type, or one the endpoint does not declare, does not
  compile. A widget or a summary naming an endpoint that is not a declared read
  does not compile either.
- **Endpoints are named by their key.** The manifest id is
  `plugin.<publicId>.<key>`, and everywhere the definition refers to an endpoint
  (a widget, a sample, a parameter's `options_from`, a bundled dashboard) it
  uses the key.
- **Everything else is the contract's own shape**, from
  [`manifest.contract.json`](manifest.contract.json): `vendor`, `connections`
  (keyed by id), `webhooks`, `surfaces` (the contract's embeds, keyed by id),
  `dashboards`. The types are generated from the contract, so every term the
  contract declares has a type here.
- **Features follow from what is filled in.** A plug-in with widgets declares
  `widgets`, and so on.

### What a handler is handed

| | |
|---|---|
| `params` | What the caller sent, by the declared names. Initiative sends strings; an automation may send numbers and booleans as they are. |
| `installation` | The community, by the reference this plug-in's install knows it by. What your own rows key on. |
| `actor` | `{ kind: "installation" }`, or `{ kind: "member", member }` when another plug-in called as one of the community's members. |
| `caller` | The plug-in that made the call through Initiative, or null for Initiative's own. |
| `initiative` | The initiative the call is confined to, or null. |
| `connections` | Connection id → the handle Initiative gives a vendor token for. |
| `client` | Initiative, already acting as `actor` and narrowed to `initiative`. |
| `context` | What you gave `createPlugin` (below). |

A handler answers `{ result }`, and `actor` too when the call ran on another
credential than the call's own (a read that always uses the community's
installation, say). To refuse, throw `new EndpointError(status, code, detail)`;
anything else thrown is answered 500 and logged.

A `write` is reachable only through another plug-in, as one of the actors it
declares, and only when it is `public`. The SDK refuses anything else before
the handler runs.

### Hooks

```ts
hooks: {
  after_connect: async ({ connection, actor, access_token, params, client }) => {
    const login = await vendorLogin(access_token);
    return { values: { login }, account_label: `@${login}` }; // or { refuse: true }
  },
  revoke: async ({ connection, access_token, refresh_token }) => { /* end the grant */ },
  webhook: async ({ connection, headers, body, client }) => {
    await client.emitEvent({ eventType: "plugin.acme.tracker.ticket-opened", payload: { number: 7 } });
  },
},
```

- `after_connect` runs once a connection's flow has exchanged its code, when
  the flow sets `after_connect`.
- `revoke` runs when a connection whose flow says `revoke: "hook"` ends. A
  flow can instead have Initiative end the grant itself: `rfc7009` posts to
  `revoke_url`, and `github_grant` sends GitHub's "Delete an app authorization"
  (`DELETE` with the client's credentials and the access token) to it.
- `webhook` runs once per community for each vendor delivery Initiative
  received, checked and routed; `headers` are the vendor's `x-` headers,
  lowercased, and `body` is exactly what the vendor sent.
- Each schedule's `run` is called once per community each interval, with
  `since`: when it last succeeded there, or null the first time.

A hook that throws is answered 500: a connection is then not recorded, and a
delivery or a schedule is tried again.

### The vendor's own setup

`vendor.fields` are the values an operator gives once per deployment for the
vendor's client. When the vendor can create that client itself, `vendor.setup`
says how, and Initiative runs it from the operator's browser and writes what
the vendor answers into those fields. One kind exists, `github_app_manifest`
(GitHub's app manifest flow):

```ts
vendor: {
  fields: [
    { key: "app_id", type: "string", required: true, label: { en: "App id" } },
    { key: "private_key", type: "secret", required: true, label: { en: "Private key" } },
    // …
  ],
  setup: {
    kind: "github_app_manifest",
    app: {
      name: "Acme Tracker",
      url: "https://tracker.acme.example",
      default_permissions: { issues: "write", metadata: "read" },
      default_events: ["issues"],
    },
    values: { app_id: "id", private_key: "pem" /* , … */ },
  },
},
```

- `app` is what GitHub is asked to create: its name, its homepage (https),
  whether any account may install it (`public`, default false), and its
  permissions and events by GitHub's names. Initiative fills in the callback,
  setup, webhook and redirect URLs itself, so `app` names none.
- `values` maps each of your vendor field keys to one field of GitHub's answer:
  `id`, `slug`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `pem` or `webhook_secret`. Each
  key must be a vendor field, each answer is written at most once, and
  `client_secret`, `pem` and `webhook_secret` go to `secret` fields.

### Surfaces

A surface is one of your plug-in's pages, framed by Initiative:

```ts
surfaces: {
  board: {
    path: "/board",
    name: { en: "Board" },
    scopes: ["initiative"],
    handler: async ({ request, handoff }) => {
      if (!handoff) return servePage(request); // the page's own files
      return startSession(handoff.viewer, handoff.initiative);
    },
  },
},
```

Initiative hands the frame a one-use handoff token. Send it from the page to
any path under the surface's as `Authorization: Bearer …`: the SDK verifies it
(type, signature, audience, surface, and that it was not used before) and hands the
handler `viewer`, `admin`, `initiative` and a `client` acting as the
installation, narrowed to that initiative.

### Where a community stands

`communitySummary` names a read whose returns say what a community has used and
is allowed. A deployment may draw them on the community's settings page, each
under its own `label`. A return with `of` is counted against another, so the two
are drawn as one measure:

```ts
returns: {
  runs_used: { type: "int", label: { en: "Runs this month" }, of: "allowance" },
  allowance: { type: "int", label: { en: "Monthly allowance" } }, // null: no ceiling
  pack_credits: { type: "int", label: { en: "Credits left" } },
  resets_on: { type: "datetime", label: { en: "Resets" } },
},
```

### Minimum age

`minimumAge` says how old somebody must be to use the plug-in, by ISO 3166-1
alpha-2 country, with `default` for every country not listed:
`{ default: 16, US: 13 }`. It is a declaration; whether a deployment enforces
it is the deployment's decision.

## 2. Widgets

A widget is a module exporting `render`, typed from the endpoint it draws:

```ts
// src/widgets/open-count.ts
import type { Scene, WidgetData } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/widget";
import type { openTickets } from "../plugin.js";

export function render(data: WidgetData<typeof openTickets>): Scene {
  return { v: 1, scene: { kind: "metric", value: data.values.total ?? 0, label: "Open" } };
}
```

`data.rows` holds one entry per index across the endpoint's `list` returns,
and `data.values` its single-valued returns. `render` also receives the tile's
options and `{ locale, slots }`.

The build bundles each widget, with everything it imports, into the one script
Initiative runs in a sandbox with no network, DOM or timers, and checks the
contract's size cap. A widget imports nothing at run time.

## 3. Build

```sh
npx initiative-plugin build              # writes manifest.json
npx initiative-plugin build --check      # CI: fails if manifest.json is stale
```

`build` reads `src/plugin.ts` (`--plugin <file>` for another), bundles the widgets,
checks the result with `validateManifest`, and writes `manifest.json`. Commit
it and ship it with the plug-in: the server serves it, and refuses to start if it
no longer matches the definition.

## 4. Serve

```ts
// src/main.ts
import plugin from "./plugin.js";
import { createPlugin, serve } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/server";

serve(createPlugin(plugin));
```

`createPlugin(plugin, options)` returns a web-standard `(Request) => Promise<Response>`
handler, so the same plug-in runs on any runtime, or behind any framework, that
speaks `Request` and `Response`. `serve` runs it on `node:http`, on `PORT`
(default 8080).

| Route | |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz` | Answer once the process is up. |
| `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` | The plug-in's public key. |
| `GET /.well-known/initiative-plugin.json` | The manifest document: the manifest with the plug-in's id, uid and name. |
| `GET, POST /v1/endpoints` | What the plug-in declares; Initiative's endpoint calls, on a context token. |
| `POST /v1/hooks/{name}` | Initiative's hook calls, on a lifecycle token for that hook. |
| a surface's path | The surface's handler. |

Every call's token is verified against the deployment's JWKS, which is cached
and refetched once for a key it does not know. Each kind carries its own `typ`
(`initiative-context+jwt` on endpoint and hook calls, `initiative-handoff+jwt` on
a page handoff), and each path takes only its own kind. Bodies are capped at 5 MiB. A
refusal answers `{ "error": code, "detail": sentence }`.

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | `INITIATIVE_BASE_URL` | Initiative's API as the plug-in reaches it, such as `http://initiative:8173/api/v1`. |
| `key` | `INITIATIVE_PLUGIN_PRIVATE_KEY`, `INITIATIVE_PLUGIN_KEY_ID` | The plug-in's key: PEM, PEM with literal `\n`, or base64 of the PEM, and the `kid` it is registered under (default: its RFC 7638 thumbprint). |
| `dataDir` | `INITIATIVE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR`, else `data` | With no key given, one is generated on first start and kept here as `plugin-key.pem`. |
| `manifest` | `manifest.json` | The built manifest. |
| `context` | | Handed to every handler as `context`. |
| `fetch`, `now`, `log`, `env` | | For tests and other runtimes. |

**The plug-in's key.** With no key given, the plug-in generates an ES256 key the first
time it starts, keeps it, and serves its public half at
`/.well-known/jwks.json`. The deployment running it registers that JWKS with
Initiative, beside where the plug-in runs, in its `PLUGIN_SERVICES_CONFIG` entry or
under **Settings → Platform → Integrations → Plug-in services**. At every start
the plug-in logs each key it serves:

```text
plug-in key fingerprint: <thumbprint> (kid <kid>)
```

The fingerprint is the key's RFC 7638 SHA-256 thumbprint, base64url without
padding, the value Initiative shows when the operator connects the plug-in, so the
two can be compared. `jwkThumbprint` from `initiative-plugin-sdk/client` computes
it for a JWKS entry. To bring your own key:

```sh
npx initiative-plugin keygen --alg ES256 --out ./secrets
```

`private-key.pem` (mode 0600) stays with the plug-in; `jwks.json` is its public
half. To rotate, publish a JWKS holding both keys, switch the plug-in to the new
one, then drop the old entry.

**Context.** Your own services reach handlers as `context`. Say what it holds
once:

```ts
declare module "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest" {
  interface PluginContext {
    tracker: TrackerClient;
  }
}

serve(createPlugin(plugin, { context: { tracker: new TrackerClient() } }));
```

## 5. Call Initiative

A handler's `client` already acts for its call. Outside a call, make one:

```ts
import { Initiative, loadPrivateKey } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/client";

const initiative = new Initiative({
  baseUrl: "https://initiative.example.com/api/v1",
  publicId: "acme.tracker",
  key: loadPrivateKey(pem, "plugin-1"),
});

for (const { installation, active } of await initiative.installations()) {
  if (!active) continue; // paused: keep what you hold for it
  const client = initiative.asInstallation(installation);
  const { items } = await client.api.listProjects({ query: { initiative_id: 12 } });
}
```

- `asInstallation(installation, { initiative, scopes })` acts as the community,
  optionally narrowed to one initiative the plug-in is placed in and fewer scopes.
- `asMember(installation, member, { purpose, initiative })` acts for one
  member, within what they consented to (`client.requestConsent(…)`);
  `ConsentRequiredError` says they have not.
- `client.api` has a typed method for every route Initiative's plug-in API
  describes, named after the route's operation id in camel case. A call takes
  its arguments by where they go, and answers the route's typed response:

  ```ts
  const task = await client.api.updateTask({ path: { task_id: 7 }, body: { title: "Ship it" } });
  await client.api.archiveEntity({ path: { entity_type: "file", entity_id: 3 } });
  ```

  No call is sent unless the token holds the scope it needs: the route's own,
  the one its argument picks (`archiveEntity` on a `file` needs
  `files:write`), or, where Initiative checks each item, at least one of
  them. `MissingScopeError` names the scope instead. Writing implies reading.

  `client.api` is generated from the plug-in API contract this SDK publishes
  ([The plug-in API contract](#the-plug-in-api-contract)), so it changes as
  the contract does: a minor release adds routes and fields, and only a major
  release removes or changes one.
  `PluginApiSchemas["TaskRead"]` names a schema's type.
- `client.request(method, path, { scope, body })` calls a community route (the
  path after `/c/{community}`) by hand, with the same scope check.
- `client.callPlugin(publicId, endpointId, params)` calls another plug-in's public
  endpoint through Initiative. It needs `plugins:<publicId>` among the plug-in's
  scopes, granted by the community.
- The installation itself, on any installation token: `client.config()`,
  `client.connections()`, `client.connectionToken(ref)` for a usable vendor
  token, `client.reportConfigStatus({ state, detail })`, and
  `client.emitEvent({ eventType, payload, initiativeId })`.

The plug-in authenticates with its key (`private_key_jwt`, RFC 7523). Tokens are
opaque; the client caches each until shortly before it expires, shares one
request between concurrent callers, and sends a call answered 401 once more on
a fresh token. A refusal raises `InitiativeApiError` with Initiative's
`detail`; the token endpoint's own refusal raises `InitiativeAuthError`.

## 6. Publish

Initiative installs plug-ins from signed registries. A listing names the plug-in, its
versions, the container image each runs (pinned by digest) and the most it may
ever be granted. It names no keys: each deployment runs its own copy of the
image and registers the key that copy signs with. Declare it in the definition:

```ts
listing: {
  publisher: "acme",
  summary: "Your tracker's tickets on a dashboard and in your automations.",
  description: "…",
  avatar: "assets/avatar.png",
  version: "1.2.0",
  minAppVersion: "0.72.0",
  releaseNotes: "…",
  image: "ghcr.io/acme/tracker@sha256:…",
  compose: {
    service: `tracker:
  image: \${IMAGE}
  environment:
    INITIATIVE_URL: \${INITIATIVE_URL}
  volumes: [tracker-keys:/data]`,
    baseUrl: "http://tracker:8080",
  },
},
```

`compose` is optional: the Docker Compose service an operator copies to run
your image beside Initiative, which Initiative shows on the plug-in's settings
page. `service` is the fragment, YAML text of at most 4096 characters, with two
placeholders Initiative fills: `${IMAGE}` (`image`, pinned by its digest) and
`${INITIATIVE_URL}` (the deployment's public address). Any other `${…}` fails
the build, so a misspelt placeholder cannot ship. `baseUrl` is where the
service answers on the Compose network, an http or https URL of at most 512
characters; Initiative pre-fills the deployment's base URL with it.

`minAppVersion` is the oldest Initiative release a version runs on. Beside it,
the definition's `minPluginApi` (the manifest's `min_plugin_api`) is the
oldest [plug-in API contract](#the-plug-in-api-contract) the plug-in calls, as
`"MAJOR.MINOR"`: the SDK version its `client.api` was written against.

```ts
definePlugin({ publicId: "acme.tracker", /* … */ minPluginApi: "4.1" });
```

A deployment serving contract `4.3.2` runs it; one serving `4.0.5` or `5.0.0`
does not. Leave it out and the plug-in makes no claim: it is offered on any
contract, as listings written before the field were.

```sh
npx initiative-plugin build --registry ../registry/sources
```

writes the plug-in's registry source under `<publisher>/<uid>/`: `listing.json`,
this version's `<version>/manifest.json` and the avatar. It is written only
while `listing.version` is the package's own version: between releases the
package runs ahead of its listing, and a new version is listed at its release,
with its image's digest. The registry's CI checks and signs what is merged.

A plug-in written in another language builds its manifest itself and hands the
SDK a JSON file in place of `src/plugin.ts`: its `publicId`, `uid` and `name`,
its `manifest`, and its `listing` as declared above. The manifest is checked as
a definition's is, and the listing states the version it lists:

```sh
npx initiative-plugin build --manifest plugin.json --registry ../registry/sources
npx initiative-plugin pack --manifest plugin.json
```

A self-hosted deployment can also publish a plug-in that is in no registry, from
its listing file: see [A private plug-in](#a-private-plug-in).

## Declarative integrations

A plug-in that only calls a vendor's API and reshapes the answer needs no
container. Name the `hosts` it calls and give each endpoint a `request` and a
`map` in place of a handler: Initiative makes the call with the connection's
credential, and maps the answer itself. The plug-in has no `service` block, no
image and nothing to run, and its listing registers it as `declarative`.

```ts
// src/plugin.ts
import { definePlugin, defineEndpoint } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest";

export const openIssues = defineEndpoint({
  direction: "read",
  label: { en: "Open issues" },
  params: { repo: { type: "string", label: { en: "Repository" }, required: true } },
  requires: { all_of: ["account"] },
  returns: { titles: { type: "string", list: true }, total: "int" },
  request: {
    method: "GET",
    url: '"https://api.tracker.example/repos/" & params.repo & "/issues"',
    query: { state: '"open"' },
    connection: "account",
  },
  map: '{"titles": response.body.title[], "total": $count(response.body)}',
});

export default definePlugin({
  publicId: "acme.tracker",
  uid: "K7M2QX8N4TVB9C",
  name: "Acme Tracker",
  hosts: ["api.tracker.example"],
  connections: {
    account: {
      scope: "interactive",
      label: { en: "Your account" },
      fields: [],
      flow: {
        type: "oauth2",
        authorize_url: "https://tracker.example/oauth/authorize",
        token_url: "https://tracker.example/oauth/token",
        client_id: "{vendor.client_id}",
      },
    },
  },
  vendor: { fields: [{ key: "client_id", type: "string", required: true, label: { en: "Client id" } }] },
  endpoints: { "open-issues": openIssues },
  listing: { publisher: "acme", summary: "Your tracker's issues.", avatar: "assets/avatar.png", version: "1.0.0" },
});
```

```ts
// test/open-issues.test.ts
import { expect, it } from "vitest";
import { runEndpoint } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/testing";
import plugin from "../src/plugin.js";
import issues from "./fixtures/issues.json" with { type: "json" };

it("lists a repository's open issues", async () => {
  const run = await runEndpoint(plugin, "open-issues", {
    params: { repo: "acme/web" },
    now: "2026-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    responses: [{ status: 200, body: issues }],
  });
  expect(run.requests).toEqual([
    {
      method: "GET",
      url: "https://api.tracker.example/repos/acme/web/issues?state=open",
      headers: {},
      connection: "account",
    },
  ]);
  expect(run).toMatchObject({ result: { titles: ["Broken build"], total: 1 } });
});
```

- **Every expression is [JSONata](https://jsonata.org)**, standard, with no
  functions added: the URL, each query parameter and header, the body or a
  GraphQL request's `variables`, and the map. An expression reads `params`,
  `connection` (the non-secret fields of the connection its request names),
  `connections` (on an endpoint, each connection its `requires` names that the
  call has, by id: `connections.workspace.owner`), `now`, and once a call has
  been answered `response` (`status`, `headers`, `body`). `build` parses
  every one and fails with its place in the manifest when one does not parse.
- **Each evaluation is bounded** by the contract's `CAPS.expressionTimeMs`,
  `CAPS.expressionDepth` and `CAPS.expressionOutputBytes`; past one, or on an
  error, the call answers `unavailable: mapping-failed`. `evaluate` from
  `initiative-plugin-sdk/testing` runs an expression within the same bounds.
- **Credentials never enter an expression.** Initiative adds the one the
  request's `connection` names, as `auth` says: `Authorization: Bearer
  <token>` unless `auth: { header, prefix }` says otherwise. Every address
  must be https on one of `hosts`, exact or with one leading `*.` label. A
  request or step on an `interactive` connection names it in the endpoint's
  `requires` too, or `build` fails. A call made as a member carries a
  `static` connection's credential only when `requires` names it, and is
  refused otherwise.
- **`steps`** in place of `request` makes up to three calls in order; each
  reads the earlier ones as `steps.<name>`, and so does the map.
- **`paging`** on a request reads more pages before the map runs:
  `page_number`, `link_header` or `cursor`, each with `max_pages` (at most 10)
  and `on_limit`, `truncate` or `refuse`.
- **Errors.** 401 and 403 answer `unavailable: not-authorized`, 404
  `not-found`, other 4xx `invalid`, and 429, 3xx and 5xx are transient.
  `errors` rows match a status (`404` or `"4xx"`) and an optional `when`, such
  as a GraphQL error inside a 200, to a code the endpoint declares in
  `unavailable`, or to `transient`. A map may answer
  `{"unavailable": "<code>"}` itself.
- **Connections** take a declarative `after_connect` (a request or up to
  three `steps`, a map to `{values, account_label}`, and `refuse_when` with
  its `code`, which read each step as `steps.<name>`) and a
  `health` check run on an interval. **Webhooks** take `events`, each mapping
  a delivery to one of the plug-in's emissions, and `status` rows that set a
  connection's state; a delivery may be routed by a `header` instead of a
  body `path`.
- **One plug-in is one kind.** A declarative plug-in has no handlers, hooks,
  schedules or surfaces, and asks for no scopes; a container plug-in uses none of
  these terms. `validateManifest` and `build` refuse a mix.

`runEndpoint`, `runAfterConnect`, `runHealth` and `runWebhook` render each
request as Initiative sends it, less the credential, answer it from the
recorded `responses` in order, and return the requests beside the result or
the code the run answered. `runEndpoint` takes each connection's fields by id
in `connections`; it has no actor, so it does not refuse a call the way
Initiative would for who is making it. A run fails when a request has no recorded answer
left, when an answer is left over, or when the map's answer does not fit the
declared returns.

## A private plug-in

A deployment's owner can publish a plug-in of their own, which then sits on that
deployment's shelf beside the registry's. Start one from the example, a
declarative plug-in with one read and one widget:

```sh
npx initiative-plugin-sdk init my-plugin      # copies examples/minimal, with a uid of its own
cd my-plugin && npm install && npm test
```

```sh
npx initiative-plugin pack                 # writes <publicId>-<version>.json
```

`pack` builds the plug-in as `build` does, checks it the same way, and writes its
**listing file**: what the catalogue shows, this version's manifest, and the
plug-in's registration. The deployment publishes it as it is, from
`POST /api/v1/marketplace/local/upload` (the file as `{"manifest": …}`) or from
its catalog directory (`MARKETPLACE_EXTRA_CATALOG_DIR`). The listing's picture
is named by its digest, so upload it beside the file, to
`POST /api/v1/marketplace/local/media`; PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP are kept, and
any other picture leaves the deployment's default mark. Both routes take the
owner's session or personal API key. A container plug-in packs too, and is live
once its service is registered on the deployment.

```sh
npx initiative-plugin dev --initiative https://initiative.example.com --api-key ppk_…
```

`dev` packs a declarative plug-in and uploads it, with its picture, to your
deployment, then again a moment after each change in the directory holding
`src/plugin.ts`. The key may be given as `INITIATIVE_API_KEY` instead. It prints
each upload and the deployment's answer:

```text
uploaded example.gitlab-issues 1.0.0-dev.3f9a2c1b (uid ZNV2THEZGPHXXG): 201 {"uid":"ZNV2THEZGPHXXG","public_id":"example.gitlab-issues","version":"1.0.0-dev.3f9a2c1b"}
watching src for changes
```

A deployment publishes each version once, so each upload is versioned
`<listing version>-dev.<digest>`. A community that installed the plug-in moves to
it from its Update button, or on its own if it follows updates. The plug-in is
offered once the vendor values its manifest requires are set under the
deployment's plug-in services.

## Validating by hand

```sh
npx initiative-plugin validate manifest.json   # a manifest, or a served manifest document
npx initiative-plugin schema                   # the JSON Schema it checks against
```

`validateManifest` runs the bundled JSON Schema, then the checks a schema
cannot express: features against the blocks present, ids that must name
something the manifest declares, connection, vendor setup and schedule rules,
and every term the contract does not declare (a deployment discards those
without saying so). The deployment also enforces byte-size caps.

## The contract

`manifest.contract.json` is the one hand-written statement of what a manifest
may say. `schemas/plugin-manifest.json` and `src/contract.ts` (its types) are
generated from it with `npm run generate`; `npm run check:generated` fails when
either is stale. Initiative vendors the contract from this repository's tags.

## The plug-in API contract

A plug-in and Initiative release on their own schedules. What they share is
one file this package publishes, `schemas/plugin-api.json`, exported as
`initiative-plugin-sdk/plugin-api.json`: the OpenAPI document of every route a
plug-in may call, as Initiative describes it. A plug-in depends on an SDK
version and nothing else.

- **The contract version is this package's version.** The file's
  `info.version` is the SDK's version, and `info["x-initiative-source"]` names
  the Initiative release and commit the document was taken from. A minor
  release adds operations, fields or optional parameters; removing or changing
  anything is a major release.
- **Every client comes from the file.** `src/plugin-api.generated.ts`, behind
  `client.api`, is generated from `schemas/plugin-api.json`, never from
  Initiative directly. A plug-in in another language generates its own client
  from the same file, at the SDK version it targets.
- **A deployment serves the contract it vendors.** Initiative carries a copy of
  this file from an SDK release, serves that SDK version as its plug-in API
  version, and checks in its own CI that what it serves still holds every
  route, parameter and response field the copy has. It may serve more.
- **A plug-in names the oldest contract it needs**, as `min_plugin_api`
  (`"MAJOR.MINOR"`) in its manifest. A deployment serving contract `S` runs a
  plug-in needing `N` when they share a major version and `S`'s minor is at
  least `N`'s. A manifest without the field runs on any contract.
  Initiative, the registry and the SDK decide with the same rule, exported as
  `pluginApiCompatible`:

  ```ts
  import { pluginApiCompatible } from "initiative-plugin-sdk/manifest";

  pluginApiCompatible("4.3.2", "4.1"); // true
  pluginApiCompatible("5.0.0", "4.1"); // false: another major
  pluginApiCompatible("4.3.2", undefined); // true: no claim
  ```

The file is never edited by hand. Take it again when Initiative's plug-in API
grows, from a checkout, a release or a running deployment; this rewrites the
file at the package's version and then the client from it:

```sh
npm run generate:plugin-api -- --checkout ../initiative   # runs its export with uv
npm run generate:plugin-api -- --release v0.75.0
npm run generate:plugin-api -- --url https://initiative.example.com
```

With no source, `npm run generate:plugin-api` regenerates the client from the
file and restamps its `info.version` with the package's; the Promote workflow
does this when it bumps the version. `npm run check:generated` fails when
either the file's version or the client is stale.

## Scopes

| Scope | Grants |
|---|---|
| `projects:read`, `projects:write` | Projects and what belongs to them: tasks, statuses, checklists. |
| `files:read`, `files:write` | Files: text documents, whiteboards, spreadsheets, links and uploads. |
| `queues:read`, `queues:write` | Queues, their items and commands. |
| `counter_groups:read`, `counter_groups:write` | Counter groups, their counters and commands. |
| `calendars:read`, `calendars:write` | Calendars, events and attendees. |
| `dashboards:read`, `dashboards:write` | Dashboards. |
| `posts:read`, `posts:write` | Posts, including pinning. |
| `galleries:read`, `galleries:write` | Galleries. |
| `wikis:read`, `wikis:write` | Wikis and their pages. |
| `comments:read`, `comments:write` | Comments on what the plug-in can read. |
| `relationships:read`, `relationships:write` | Links between items the plug-in can reach. |
| `tags:read`, `tags:write` | Reading, creating and applying tags. |
| `properties:read`, `properties:write` | Reading an initiative's custom property definitions and their options, and creating, changing and removing them. Setting a value on an item takes that item's own scope instead: a task's with `projects:write`. |
| `sharing:read`, `sharing:write` | Seeing who has access to something, and changing it where the plug-in's own access allows it. |
| `members:read` | The roster, as references, display names and avatars. |
| `initiatives:read` | The initiatives the plug-in is placed in. |
| `initiatives:moderate` | Acting as a moderator in an initiative it is placed in: everything there, within the plug-in's other scopes. Only on a token that asks for it (`level=moderator`) and is narrowed to that initiative. |
| `community:admin` | Acting with a community admin's standing across the community, within the plug-in's other scopes. Only on a token that asks for it (`level=community_admin`) and is not narrowed to an initiative. |
| `plugins:<public id>` | Calling that plug-in's public endpoints through Initiative. One per plug-in. |

Writing implies reading. Within its scopes a plug-in still sees only what is open
to the initiative, shared with the plug-in, or created by it — unless a token asks
for one of the two standings above. Those are never on a token by default: ask
for one with `asInstallation(installation, { initiative, level: "moderator" })`
or `asInstallation(installation, { level: "community_admin" })`, and Initiative
refuses it unless the community granted the matching scope. A member token
takes no `level`.
