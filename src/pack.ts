/**
 * `initiative-plugin pack`: the plug-in as one listing file, the file a self-hosted
 * deployment publishes as its own plug-in.
 *
 * The listing file is the shape a deployment's listing upload
 * (`POST /api/v1/marketplace/local/upload`, as `{"manifest": <file>}`) and its
 * catalog directory (`MARKETPLACE_EXTRA_CATALOG_DIR`) read: what the catalogue
 * shows, this version's manifest as its `definition`, and its registration.
 * The manifest is the one `build` makes, checked the same way.
 *
 * The listing's picture is named by the path the deployment keeps it under,
 * which is the SHA-256 of its bytes, so it is uploaded beside the file
 * (`POST /api/v1/marketplace/local/media`). A deployment keeps PNG, JPEG, GIF
 * and WebP; any other picture is left out, and the listing shows the
 * deployment's default mark.
