/**
 * Verifying the tokens Initiative signs when it reaches the plug-in.
 *
 * Both kinds are RS256 JWTs signed with the deployment's key and published in
 * its JWKS at `/api/v1/plugin-platform/jwks.json`:
 *
 * - **Context token**, on every call to the plug-in (`Authorization: Bearer …`).
 *   Scope `endpoint` is a call to one endpoint, named by `endpoint_id`; scope
 *   `lifecycle` is a call to one hook, named by `hook`. When another plug-in made
 *   the call through Initiative it also carries `act` (that plug-in), `actor`,
 *   `member` and, when the caller was confined to one, `initiative_id`. When a
 *   block on Initiative's own screens made it, it carries `task_ids` (the tasks
 *   it is about) and, for a `per_viewer` read or an action, `viewer`.
 * - **Handoff token**, when a member opens one of the plug-in's pages. It names
 *   the member (`sub`), the page, and the initiative it was opened in. It is
 *   for one use.
 *
 * Each is checked the same way: the `kid` against the deployment's JWKS, the
 * signature, `iss` = `initiative`, `aud` = `initiative-plugin:<public id>`, and
 * `exp`/`iat` against the clock with a small leeway.
