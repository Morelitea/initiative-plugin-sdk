/**
 * `initiative-plugin build`: the files a plug-in's definition produces.
 *
 * - `manifest.json`: the manifest, with each widget's template file read into
 *   its `template`, after `validateManifest` has passed it. That parses
 *   every JSONata expression a declarative plug-in gives, so one that does not
 *   parse fails the build at its place in the manifest.
 * - With `--registry <dir>`, the plug-in's registry source under
 *   `<dir>/<publisher>/<uid>/`: `listing.json`, this version's
 *   `<version>/manifest.json` and the avatar. It is written only while the
 *   listing names the package's own version: between releases the package
 *   runs ahead of its listing, and what the listing already publishes is left
 *   as it was.
 *
 * With `--check` nothing is written, and any file that differs from what would
 * be written is a failure.
 *
 * A plug-in built outside TypeScript gives `--manifest <file>` in place of its
 * definition: a JSON file holding its manifest and its listing
 * ({@link BuiltPlugin}). It is checked as a definition's manifest is, and its
 * registry source is written from its listing, which states the version it
 * lists; no `manifest.json` is written beside it.
 *
 * Loading a TypeScript definition uses esbuild, which the plug-in installs
 * beside the SDK (`npm install --save-dev esbuild`). Nothing at run time needs it.
